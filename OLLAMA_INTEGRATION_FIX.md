# Ollama Integration Fix for Document Q&A Chatbot

## Problem Summary
The original Ollama integration was failing with the error: `TypeError: createOllama is not a function`.
This was due to issues with importing and using the Ollama package in a Next.js environment.

## Solution
We replaced the problematic client-based approach with direct API calls to the Ollama server.

## Changes Made:

1. Updated `lib/ollama-config.ts`:
   - Removed the problematic `createOllamaClient()` function that was trying to use the Ollama npm package
   - Replaced embedding generation with direct API calls to `http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings`
   - Replaced text generation with direct API calls to `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`

2. Verified Ollama functionality:
   - Created test scripts to verify direct API calls to Ollama work correctly
   - Confirmed both embedding generation and text generation are working

3. Enabled Ollama integration:
   - Added `USE_OLLAMA=true` to `.env.local` file

## How to Test
1. Run the Ollama direct test: `node test-ollama-direct.js`
2. This will test both embedding generation and text generation
3. Ensure the application is configured to use Ollama with `USE_OLLAMA=true` in `.env.local`

## Benefits
1. No more dependency on the problematic Ollama npm package
2. Direct API calls are more reliable and have fewer dependencies
3. Simpler code that works better with Next.js
4. Free from Google API rate limits since everything runs locally

## Next Steps
1. Upload documents through the UI and test the embedding generation
2. Test the chat functionality with the documents
3. Monitor the application logs for any other issues
